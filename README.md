# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

# What is Requirement Analysis?
- Requirement Analysis is a crucial phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the needs and expectations of stakeholders (such as clients, users, and business managers) are gathered, analyzed, and documented. The goal is to understand what the system should do, rather than how it will be implemented. This phase results in a clear, complete, and agreed-upon set of requirements that form the foundation for subsequent design, development, and testing stages.
         
# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
  - The end software product will meet user and client expectations.
  - It identifies requirements gaps and inconsistencies.
  - It can save time and resources later in the software development life cycle process.
  - The project team won't misinterpret or misunderstand the client's needs.

# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.
   - Requirement Gathering
   - Requirement Elicitation
   - Requirement Documentation
   - Requirement Analysis and Modeling
   - Requirement Validation.

# Types of Requirements
- Functional Requirements Focus on the system’s features and operations.	
 ## Non-functional Requirements Focus on the system’s performance, reliability, and usability.
   - Functional Requirements
       - Define specific behaviors or functions of the system.
       - Examples: user authentication, data processing, report generation.
   - Non-Functional Requirements
      - Specify the criteria for system performance and quality.
       - Examples: scalability, reliability, security, usability.
