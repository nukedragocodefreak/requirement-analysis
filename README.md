# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

# What is Requirement Analysis?
- Requirement Analysis is a crucial phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the needs and expectations of stakeholders (such as clients, users, and business managers) are gathered, analyzed, and documented. The goal is to understand what the system should do, rather than how it will be implemented. This phase results in a clear, complete, and agreed-upon set of requirements that form the foundation for subsequent design, development, and testing stages.

- Types of Requirements
   - Functional Requirements
       - Define specific behaviors or functions of the system.
       - Examples: user authentication, data processing, report generation.
   - Non-Functional Requirements
      - Specify the criteria for system performance and quality.
       - Examples: scalability, reliability, security, usability.
